# Data Types
Python has several built-in data types, including:

Integers: Numbers without decimals, such as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Strings: Sequences of characters, such as "hello", "world", and "python".

Floats: Numbers with decimals, such as 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0.

Booleans: Variables that can hold either the value True or False.

# Variables
Variables are used to store data in Python. They are written in the following format:

Python
variable_name = value
Use code with caution. Learn more
For example, the following code defines a variable called name and stores the value "John Doe" in it:

Python
name = "John Doe"
Use code with caution. Learn more
Arithmetic Operations
Python supports the following arithmetic operators:

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
//	Integer division
%	Modulus
Comparison Operators
Python supports the following comparison operators:

Operator	Description
==	Equal to
!=	Not equal to
<	Less than
>	Greater than
<=	Less than or equal to
>=	Greater than or equal to
Control Flow
Python uses the following control flow statements:

Statement	Description
if ... else	Executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if it is false.
for ... in	Iterates over a sequence of values.
while ... :	Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
Input and Output
Python uses the following functions to read and write data from and to files:

Function	Description
input()	Reads input from the user and returns it as a string.
print()	Prints text to the console.
Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items. They can be created using square brackets ([]):

Python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Use code with caution. Learn more
Accessing items in a list is done using indexing:

Python
first_item = my_list[0]
second_item = my_list[1]
Use code with caution. Learn more
Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They can be created using curly braces ({}):

Python
my_dict = {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
Use code with caution. Learn more
Accessing items in a dictionary is done using keys:

Python
name = my_dict['name']
age = my_dict['age']
city = my_dict['city']
Use code with caution. Learn more
Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can be reused. They are defined using the def keyword:

Python
def greet(name):
  print("Hello,", name)

greet("John Doe")
Use code with caution. Learn more
Modules
Modules are files that contain Python code. They can be imported using the import statement:

Python
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number)
